Materials for Andrew Maurer's sections of Math 1113, Fall 2018.

# Meeting 8/10/2018

Homework grades comprised of two components:
  - Pie progress
  - Objectives
    - Multiple deadlines
    - Some knowledge checks
    - Knowledge checks turned off for objectives before basic skills tests

Focus on ideas and problem solving.
  - ALEKS is good for basic manipulation, but we should be focusing on problem solving.
  - New situations++
  - Address techniques required to deal with word problems
  - Final exam moves toward problem solving.

Fallback Options:
  - UNIV 1110: Basic review of algebra, for students who have not taken it before. Deadline is Sept 26. This *does* set you back a semester wrt prereqs, so it's a big decision. In terms of corequisites: can stay in chemistry. (Students taking chem and 1113 at the same time have a 40% success rate.)
  - Math 1113 Intensive: Extra hours (class every day), can transfer with permission. Deadline is September 26. Transcript-equivalent to 1113.
  - UNIV 1202: Supplementary lab class added to schedule. (They stay in my class.) 1 section of 40 students -- get it while it's hot! TR @ 5-6. Metacognitive learning skills. 15 min "How to we learn math", rest of class "let's solve some problems".
  - Withdrawal deadline is October ??
